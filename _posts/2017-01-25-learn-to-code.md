After learning to code last year in 2016 - I want to encourage others to learn to code, even if it's as a hobby. I would have never guessed coding would be fun and exciting. I was hesistant to learn because I thought you had to be a *genius* to be good at programming. But every **expert** was *once* a **beginner** - you just have to be **determined!**

Granted, it's fun - but I never said it was easy. Learning to code takes countless hours of dedication. I went through hours of confusion, then the awesome feeling of accomplishment and then back to thinking what the hell am I doing... haha! But in the end, it was all worth it. I am constantly *learning* and *growing* and that's the beauty of it! There will always be new technologies to learn and improve on.

To me, coding is empowering and exciting, it's problem solving, it's having breakthrough moments. The sheer joy of creating an idea into something real feels amazing. For those who are creatives, if you think coding is boring, you are *mistaken*! Think about all the beautiful designs you created sitting in your computer not being used to its full potential - coding allows that to happen!
