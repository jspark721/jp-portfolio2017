I started working on a new project with Ruby on Rails. I wanted to focus this project not only on the back-end part of controllers and models but also focus on the views of this project. I wanted to make the UI aesthetically pleasing and wanted to include different effects and interactive design with JavaScript.

Take Notes is a free online notebook application where users can sign up and sign in to keep track of their notes and ideas.

<h3>The Design</h3>

<h3>Ruby gems used</h3>
- Devise for user authentication
- Simple Form to create easier and better designed forms
- Haml a templating engine for HTML for easier and more pleasant way to code HTML documents - eliminating redundancy
