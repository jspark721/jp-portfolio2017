	<h3>Coffee</h3>
	<p>I grew up in Seattle, I am a huge coffee drinker - maybe even a coffee addict! One of my favorite parts about living in Seattle is the countless of cute coffeeshops that actually serve a <em>real good</em> cup'o coffee! (P.S I like my coffee black but I like taking pictures of lattes... because it's so much prettier! hahaha)</p>

    <h3>Dogs</h3>
	<p>I am a huge dog lover. My little fur-baby is a shihtzu named Harvey. He is the sweetest, cutest, and the best dog in the world! He even has his own <a href="www.instagram.com/harveytzu" target="_blank">instagram!</a> Dogs make your life more awesome!
